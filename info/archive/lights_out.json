  "description": "We will be a doing a radio show where we will be reading out popular horror and scary stories from sites like Creepypasta, NoSleep sub-reddit, The Lore Podcast and other interesting sources. We will be visiting horror classics like the Dracula but the show will be more focused towards modern horror accounts. We will try to keep readings limited to short horror accounts. We will not only be reading them but also try to debunk them in the end and try to explain where these stories came from. Tuck yourselves in with your bed, because its horror time, Lights Out!",
