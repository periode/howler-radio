Italo dance is characterized by synthesizer-riffs, vocals modified with vocoders with catchy and simple choruses and typically a bass with a 'metallic' sound often referred to as \"Tuba -Bass\". Yes...you are right….I just picked up a definition from wikipedia. You know why? Because for me Italodance is simply music that makes me wanna dance and have fun. So whether you are in your dorm, or in the gym, or even out of campus, and you feel like letting loose and have some fun, tune in and enjoy!",
