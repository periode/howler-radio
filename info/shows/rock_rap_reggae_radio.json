  "description": "Hosted by Diego Sandoval, jokingly known as diegopositivity. I’ll be offering my listeners a wide variety of rock, rap, and reggae- including rock rap, rap reggae, reggae rock, and everything in between. Some nights you can scream along to Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, and Slipknot. Other nights you’ll have your mind blown by Immortal Technique and activist rap with some throw-back stand-up by comedians George Carlin and Bill Hicks. Other nights you can sit back and chill to SOJA, Laguna Pai, and feel Slightly Stoopid with me. Tune in on Wednesday nights at 10pm.",
