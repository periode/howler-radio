  "description": "(def.): A place of collaboration; a space of creation. Warsheh is an attempt to bring together all the elements of Arab culture, through music and dialogue. Our show is fluid by nature, as each episode will focus on different themes of Arab culture. We will explore the cultural, social, political, economic, emotional, and psychological nuances of the Arab world through its artistic productions. Our show will be mainly communicated in the Arabic language -we encourage you to listen in, even if you donâ€™t speak it.",
