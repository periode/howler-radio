  "description": "The hit 90s sitcom Seinfeld was a pioneer for being an immensely successful show about 'nothing.' This program proudly carries this mantle in to the 21st Century. Join Abu Shisha, nom de tabac of professor Adam Ramey, every Monday morning for a lively discussion and heavily editorialized commentary on contemporary politics, music, and overall pop culture, with copious amounts of 80s music played in the background. Tweet your questions by mentioning @adamramey or #abushisha on Twitter.",
