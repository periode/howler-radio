  "description": "Pwee, JJ, & More is an exploration based radio show, taking you on a journey through a different country, time, or situation every week. Each show will feature a different special guest to walk you through a 2-day visit to their respective homes - describing what to do, not do and what crazy sh*t they've seen happen. Intermixed with place-related music, chill beats and talk back on how we might see these different places here, on campus, Pwee, JJ, & more, is excited to have your ear on Howler Radio. P.S. keep an eye out for our weekly travel guides!",
