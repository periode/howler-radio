  "description": "Red light music is a bi-weekly exploration/curation of electronic-based music. Each episode's mix is guided by a different musical or personal theme, but all are united by sexy synths, seedy basslines, and stroboscopic intensity. This is music to love and hate to, cook or make love to, grind or gently touch to, and always move to.",
