  "description": "Red Light Music is a fortnightly exploration/curation of electronic-based (but not exclusively so) music. Each episode's mix is guided by a different musical theme, but all are united by sexy synths, seedy basslines, and stroboscopic intensity. This is music to love and hate to, cook or make love to, grind or gently touch to, and always move to.",
