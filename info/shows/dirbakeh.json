  "description": "Dirbakeh is here to give the audience a sense of the Middle-Eastern culture through music. We plan on introducing Arab musicians and singers, telling their stories, and playing their songs. We hope that through this show we will be able to feed some people's curiosity and help others that are already familiar with Middle-Eastern culture to connect more deeply with it.",
