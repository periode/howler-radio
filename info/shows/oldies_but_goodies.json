  "description": "Oldies but Goodies is — as the title suggests — a show devoted to music in English that we youngsters would call old. Every week there will be a one-hour session of songs that your parents probably jammed to and so you should as well. From Billie Holiday to The Beatles, there will be amazing music across all decades and genres.",
