  "description": "Tales from the Void is a sort of mish mash of a lot of different genres of Radio Dramas and audiobooks. We're going to focus on Sci fi to begin with and provide a bit of look into the mindsets of the Author and what type of reaction they were hoping to provoke. However later on we plan on adopting other genres into the show such as detective stories and westerns. Our overall goal is to both give listeners an idea of what entertainment used to be in the time before the internet and television and give a look at how the creators of these stories hoped to inspire change in the societies they lived in.",
